help=Each player has 4 game pieces, which are in the "out" area when the game starts, and which must be brought into the player's "home" row. The first player with all of their pieces in their "home" row wins the game. The players throw a die in. Throwing a six means bringing a piece into the and throwing the die again. Pieces can jump over other pieces, and throw out pieces from other players (into that player's "out" area) if they land on them.
